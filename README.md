These are example [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts to demonstrate how to execute Arc against a remote cluster.

For AWS:

- [aws-single-master](https://github.com/tripl-ai/deploy/tree/master/aws-single-master) for a single instance. 
- [aws-cluster](https://github.com/tripl-ai/deploy/tree/master/aws-cluster) for a mulit-instance cluster.
